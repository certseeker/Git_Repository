Here are some cool things I have learned during the React Fashion Blog Project

1. Navigation Bar and Link
-Link is a way you create hyperlinks by just using the text without applying href to the attribute
-Before using though, you must import in on top of the component from the react DOM

!!! Seems a though I am being too fancy on this one. I tried to connect the nav to the react DOM in order for the 
sites to switch,and I was running into issues. For the sake of time, I will continue with the basic a ref format. Hopefully I can 
learn about this method in the future.

2. Images
Here is a great resource on images, the breakdown of types
Explains how while you can put images directly in a public file, it does not preform as well if directly inserted
Also, when you insert an image into a file, ti gets added to the public file anyways.
